                    <h5 class="thumbnail" style="margin-left:317px">My name is Manogna Namburu, and I am a senior at Dublin High School. I am part of the engineering academy, specifically the computer science pathway. My journey started in my Freshman year when my parents urged me to take Computer Science Principles as an elective. At first, I was hesitant since I have never tried coding and do not know the first thing about computer science. However, since my parents are computer science engineers, I always had that curiosity regarding what they do. With that in mind, I took the course. The first thing I learned in that class was that computer science is taking real-world problems and instructing the computer on how to solve them. The simplicity and creativity of the solution all depend on the programmer, and the simpler the code is, the better. I liked the idea of trying to improve existing solutions and felt motivated to try making things better and effective. My passion for Computer Science only grew after taking Computer Science Application in my Junior year.

                    <h5 class="thumbnail" style="margin-left:317px">I am generally seen as a person who works hard to reach her goals and does not give up on the way because the workload is too much. Even at school projects, I am self-motivated to get the work done on time. I possess characteristics such as being alert, organized, and persistent; once I get engaged in some activity, I do not back out. One of my favorite hobbies is swimming. I started swimming when I was six years old. At first, I had an extreme fear of letting go of the wall of the pool in case I drown. No matter how many times my swim instructor tried to convince me, I refused to trust her and let go. In the end, I could only practice my kicks while watching the other students swim freely. I wanted to be in the middle of the pool, learning more than kicking and hand movements. With that goal in mind, I went to the neighborhood pool to try practicing on my own with no one around. I first started waddling, holding onto the wall with one hand. Then after some time, I let go and swam slowly, still close to the wall. After doing that for an hour or so, I was able to push away from the wall and swim on my own. I felt proud that I didnâ€™t give in to my fear and stop doing something I liked. Whenever I feel that I cannot do something, I think back to this memory, feeling motivated to try again.

                    <h5 class="thumbnail" style="margin-left:317px">At the beginning of the school year, I participated in an online event that brought people together to work in groups to program software addressing an issue of their choice. I worked with three of my friends to create an app called Squiggle. Squiggle is an interactive to-do list app that allows young children to check off assignments they have completed in a certain class. The app features customizable characters and a reward system. Additionally, I am volunteering as a virtual tutor for children from low-income households, as I have been doing for two years.
