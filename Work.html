            <h5 class="thumbnail" style="padding:20px">
                On this page are the field trips and influential guest speakers that I have experienced in the past four years. They helped me learn more about what I would be learning and doing to reach my future goal. Here is the link to my resume.

            <h3>Stanford University and the Museum of Computer Science 11/14/18</h3>
            <h5 class="thumbnail" style="padding:20px">
                Through this field trip, I was allowed to experience a tour of a university and later explore the Museum of Computer Science. Stanford University was a large campus with many engineering related courses. We got a tour between the engineering buildings such as mechanical engineering and computer science building. Though our tour guide was not in the engineering field she explained that many engineering fields have a high number of graduates each year. As my future goal being a computer science engineer, exploring a college with so much engineering background was helpful. Next, we went to the Museum of Computer Science where we looked at the historical background of computer science. We looked at the original computers and the original virtual games. Not only relating to computer science we also saw many artifacts related to hardware engineering such as how the computer was manufactured. Overall, the museum was a good experience for me to see how computer science gradually advanced to what we have today.

 <h3>SHE Leads Conference 2/13/19</h3>
            <h5 class="thumbnail" style="padding:20px">
               The She leads conference, consists of women in the STEM field who came to share their experience and stories with female high school students. We did various workshops, where we did fun little activities to get a better visualization of what the women do. I met many influential women who talked about their path to becoming engineers, doctors, managers, and many more. There were wide ranges of careers and helped me get a better insight into what type of careers exist for women in the STEM field. I am grateful that I got the chance to ask questions and share my own experience with the mentors.

            <h3>Simpson Strong-Tie 5/1/19</h3>
            <h5 class="thumbnail" style="padding:20px">
                Through this field trip, I was allowed to experience a tour of the Simpson Strong-Tie company which produces wood and steel construction connectors. I was first brought into a classroom-like room where we were given a presentation on the history of the company and some information on the engineers who are there to give us a tour. They talked about what their role was and how they became who they are now.

             <h3>Oracle Job Shadow 10/7/20</h3>
            <h5 class="thumbnail" style="padding:20px">
              The Oracle Job Shadow was done virtually where different people talked on zoom about their experiences in their jobs. There were three sections, with two people each time talking about what they do and how they got a job at Oracle. Each section was fifteen minutes long and the two people took turns to talk and comment on each otherâ€™s experience. I noticed how the people talking were all from different parts of the country and the world. No one person had the same journey as the other. It was interesting to see what type of requirements are needed to be selected to work at Oracle.

             <h3>Splunk Job Shadow 12/2/20</h3>
            <h5 class="thumbnail" style="padding:20px">
             The Splunk Job Shadow was similar to the Oracle one in ways that they both had three sections with two people talking at a time. Each person shared their journey to getting to where they are and talked about why they chose this field and this job. One person, in particular, talked about the impact of technology as a whole. He explained how technology is the future and the key to helping end human trafficking, abuse of children and bring relief to disaster victims. Many of the world's problems can be solved by technology. I felt very motivated after his speech and felt that I made the right choice in picking computer science as my career.

               <h3>Livermore Aviation Tour 1/28/21</h3>
            <h5 class="thumbnail" style="padding:20px">
            The Livermore Aviation Tour, gave an online detailed tour around the jets and structures. We got a detailed lesson about the history and basic principles of flight. The instructor mentioned how everything was built from scratch in order to make sure it is exactly how they wanted. There are even several flight schools at the airport.

            <h3>Maynand Holiday and Aileen Iniguez</h3>

            <h5 class="thumbnail" style="padding:20px">
                Maynand Holiday talked about how they are a mechanical engineer that works with a team that maps and samples hazardous, radioactive rooms. To do this, they would need to build a robot that would go and scan the rooms so that no human would get exposed to the radiation. During the Chernobyl nuclear disaster, safety measurements failed, and a reactor exploded, releasing toxic materials onto the world. The radiation spread around the area and caused cancer and other forms of diseases. The main job for Holiday was to build a robot that could identify areas in the building with gamma radiation and toxic fog. Once it identifies the radiation, it is programmed to take samples to bring back for further testing. Later they talked about AI, such as what they do and how well we have developed some. I was interested in how Al was programmed to do certain tasks and machine learning. Though the speaker did not go into how they were programmed it was interesting to know that the technology we use every day, such as Siri, fingerprint ID, and Face ID is all part of machine learning. The speaker made me think about maybe in the future I could work for a company that creates or improves AI or more specifically machine learning.
Aileen Iniguez shared her experience working at Chevron as a data scientist. She explained how a day in her work would look like and what type of projects she has worked on so far. She emphasized the importance and growth of the data science industry and got me thinking about how data science affects our everyday life.

    <h3>DEDA Mentor Program</h3>

            <h5 class="thumbnail" style="padding:20px">
               In Junior year, I got the opportunity to participate in the mentorship program provided by the engineering academy. Through the program, I got the chance to meet people from various engineering fields working at different positions and companies. I got the chance to learn about what it takes to become a certain engineer from education to internships. Through the program, I met my mentor, Deborah Donovan, a software engineer at Chevron. She has guided me on the path to reaching my goal. She gave me pointers on my resume, portfolio, and mock interview in order to appear more professional and highlight important notes about myself. The mentorship program overall broadens my view of what engineers do and how a person becomes an engineer in many pathways. I also felt it taught me how to connect with others in a professional manner.
