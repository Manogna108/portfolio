                On this page are the field trips and influential guest speakers that I have experienced in the past four years. They helped me learn more about what I would be learning and doing to reach my future goal. Here is the link to my resume.

                Through this field trip, I was allowed to experience a tour of a university and later explore the Museum of Computer Science. Stanford University was a large campus with many engineering related courses. We got a tour between the engineering buildings such as mechanical engineering and computer science building. Though our tour guide was not in the engineering field she explained that many engineering fields have a high number of graduates each year. As my future goal being a computer science engineer, exploring a college with so much engineering background was helpful. Next, we went to the Museum of Computer Science where we looked at the historical background of computer science. We looked at the original computers and the original virtual games. Not only relating to computer science we also saw many artifacts related to hardware engineering such as how the computer was manufactured. Overall, the museum was a good experience for me to see how computer science gradually advanced to what we have today.
