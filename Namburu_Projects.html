                            <h2>Image Manipulation Project</h2>
                              <h5 class="thumbnail" style="text-indent: 30px;">This was the hardest project I had  to design in CSE. The project required for me to take time outside
                                                of class to figure out how to write the code so there are no faults in it. For this project my partner and I were assigned to
                                                create code that would apply to a group of images at once. We had to write the code so that it would take the images in a
                                                folder and modify them the way we want it. In our code, the code takes the images and adds two borders of different sizes
                                                and tilts the pictures sideways. We had a choice of picking what the topic our manipulations are going to be on, by picking
                                                clients. My partner and I picked client 2  <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cmvTO8y1iCYaZlgTA3DhnXU4BDXMXP_MiSfSxppxUGI/edit" target="_blank">(1.4.7 Image Artist)</a>, which is a family. They wanted something simple but nice to highlight family and
                                                individual members. Before we got into this project we learned some basic knowledge about how to do image manipulations.
                                                We started small by adding small changes to images given to us by our teacher. We learned how to use different functions to get the manipulations we want.
                                                Once, the project was assigned, we needed to brainstorm ideas of what we wanted the manipulations to be. We wanted to
                                                start small and get simple manipulations done within the time given to us.The brainstorms, project log, along with the before and after pictures, are recorded in the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DytyrDAYAtNpKb8HnfSRdXKJPX1BQ4RwlJEFGY-gM-Y/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">project notebook.</a>   My role in this project was to write the code for adding borders around
                                                the picture. It took me a long time but I learned to build my code by using my teacher’s code as a model. As I continued to work on this
                                                project I learned how to write for loops to iterate my code all at once. I also learned about the various variables involved in python
                                                image manipulation. Some challenges I came upon while doing this project were that I did not have enough time to add the geometric shapes
                                                required by my client. My partner and I had to settle for the manipulations we created so far. Some skills I obtained at the end of the project was
                                                that I was able successfully to manipulate images no matter how many there are.<br />

                            <h5 class="thumbnail" style="text-indent: 30px;">For this project the given task was that Tesla Motors was investigating the use of solar and hydrogen cell to power their cars. The company wanted to gain some insight on the amount of power and speed capabilities of these sources to support their designs. In a group of four, my team and were instructed <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Rg_LW-VsEeTNoiB3OEgwSa1Mz7NgUm2taHU12W-xaoY/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">(1.3.2 Instructions)</a>
                                to design, create, and test a prototype of a car that uses a solar module and/or hydrogen fuel cell as its power source. We had to use different combinations of energy sources such as 1 hydrogen fuel cell, 2 hydrogen fuel cells in a parallel or series circuit, 1 solar cell, and 2 solar cells in a parallel or series circuit to see which configuration had the best results in time and efficiency. As a team we built a two level vehicle that can potentially hold two solar cells along with two hydrogen cells. As we tested out our different configurations we realized that our prototype works best with two solar cells compared to any other configurations. In our <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Kc8hcEWBXN2Nck5b_rZH3MLB0nt3QZ_3d3KcbSPAJls/edit" target="_blank">Documentation</a>
                                we noted all the changes and results of our different power configurations such as the efficiency of each type energy source. In this project my role was to build the compartments on the vehicle so that the solar and hydrogen cells will not just be placed on the vehicle but be mechanically built in. I was also incharge of working on the calculations of each power source and coming to a conclusion of which source was the best. As I worked on this project I learned more about the difficulties using renewable sources for a long period of time. Both solar cells and hydrogen cells have both pros and cons to them. Solar cells might generally be more efficient than hydrogen cells but the problem with them are that they do not store energy from the UV light and as a result they fail to work without a constant power source. Hydrogen cells do store energy in them but have to constantly be charged and work at a very slow pace. Some challenges with this project was with the hydrogen cells which sometimes worked but other times took quite a long time to even move. My group and I tried to make the efficient of the hydrogen cell improve but were unable to do so within our deadline. Overall, with this project I learned to use two different energy sources to power a vehicle.

                                 In this project, my partners and I were assigned to create a demo of a chatbot that does anything of our choice. It has to be able to carry a conversation with the user with at least 35 input/response pairs. We decided to create a project that will function as a virtual companion that listens to the user’s situation and responds accordingly.  In our <a href=https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bAgPUPKiL_7nXqTXvgs1Yt0mKSLBT0U6PGz94qEWVFU/edit?usp =sharing" target="_blank"> Documentation</a>  we listed all the types of inputs we want to include as well as some possible outputs. Our chatbot, EMO or also known as emotional support chatbot, responds to the user after it evaluates their statement into one of the six categories we assigned it. The six categories are all different types of emotions the user may feel such as fear, love, anger, sadness, happiness and even any physical pain. If one of these categories gets called on such as love, a generic statement would be sent to the user about love. Within each category, 5-6 keywords would trigger another generic response that gets added unto the category’s generic statement. For example, if the keyword laugh is included in the user’s input, the chatbot would first produce a generic statement about happiness since laugh is a keyword included for happiness and another statement specifically for laugh. A clear demo of how a basic conversation would could be seen in our <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1IW0579qc5pg2obWP2M4JC27n3Fewnuf5g-3KpAJHEeQ/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank"> demo</a>.

Through this project, I learned how to get a chatbot to simulate a human conversation by including certain keywords and such. I also got the chance to work with multiple interfaces to do one overall function.
